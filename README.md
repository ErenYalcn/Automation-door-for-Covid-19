# Automation-door-for-Covid-19
To minimize cases caused by Covid-19.An automation door system that opens and closes with body temperature with Arduino.
First of all, when our distance sensor detects an object 20cm or closer, the temperature sensor writes the instant measurement on the screen.
If the value is in the range of 34-38 degrees, the door opens.
If it is over 38, the door does not move and the siren sounds.
